# 🎮 Qhess - The Most Unnecessarily Complex Chess Game Ever

> **Warning**: This entire project was vibe-coded at 3 AM with nothing but energy drinks and questionable life choices. Proceed with caution.

## What Even Is This?

Qhess started as "let's make a simple chess game" and somehow evolved into a fever dream of game modes that nobody asked for but everyone secretly wanted. It's like regular chess, but if chess went to a rave, got really into cyberpunk aesthetics, and decided to become a zombie apocalypse survivor.

## 🎯 Game Modes (Because One Chess Wasn't Enough)

### Classic Mode
- Regular chess but make it ✨fancy✨
- Multiple themes because apparently wood boards are boring
- AI that may or may not be plotting world domination
- Timer that judges your life choices

### Zombie Chess Mode 🧟‍♂️
- Chess pieces can get infected and turn into zombies
- Because nothing says "strategic thinking" like a zombie apocalypse
- Your pieces literally betray you (just like in real life)
- Probably the most realistic chess variant ever created

### Survival Mode 👑
- You're just a lonely king trying to survive
- AI pieces hunt you down like you owe them money
- It's basically chess battle royale
- Surprisingly therapeutic for working through trust issues

### Shooter Mode 🚀
- Wait, this isn't chess anymore
- Your chess piece became a spaceship somehow
- Shoot other chess pieces because violence solves everything
- Has a progression system because we're all addicted to numbers going up
- Boss fights with chess pieces (yes, really)

## 🎨 Themes (For Your Aesthetic Needs)

- **Classic**: For people who like their chess boring and traditional
- **Cyberpunk**: Neon lights and existential dread
- **Neon**: More neon lights but with different existential dread
- **Space**: Chess... IN SPACE! (dramatic echo)
- **Haunted**: Spooky scary chess pieces
- **Zombie**: Green and gross, just how we like our apocalypses

## 🛠️ Technical "Architecture" (Generous Term)

### File Structure (Organized Chaos)

```

### Key Features (Bugs Disguised as Features)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, probably breaks on mobile
- **AI Integration**: Three different AIs because one wasn't confusing enough
- **Theme System**: CSS variables everywhere like confetti
- **Sound Effects**: Web Audio API abuse for "immersive" experience
- **Progression System**: Because even chess needs RPG elements now
- **Accessibility**: We tried (and actually succeeded in some places)

## 🎵 The Vibe Coding Journey

### Phase 1: "Let's Make Chess"
- Started with noble intentions
- Basic board, basic pieces, basic moves
- "This will be done in a weekend"
- *Narrator: It was not done in a weekend*

### Phase 2: "But What If..."
- "What if chess had themes?"
- "What if pieces could move themselves?"
- "What if we added zombies?"
- Sleep deprivation kicked in

### Phase 3: "Why Not a Shooter?"
- Chess pieces with guns seemed logical at 4 AM
- Canvas API became our best friend
- Particle effects because everything needs particle effects
- Boss fights with chess pieces (peak game design)

### Phase 4: "Make It Pretty"
- CSS gradients everywhere
- Animations for things that don't need animations
- Theme colors that actually work (accessibility win!)
- Dark outlines because visibility matters

### Phase 5: "AI Overlords"
- Multiple AI implementations
- Factory pattern because we read a design patterns book once
- AIs that can play different game modes
- Probably achieved sentience (unconfirmed)

## 🚀 How to Run This Beautiful Disaster

1. Clone this repository (or download the ZIP like a normal person)
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Marvel at the chaos
4. Question your life choices
5. Play chess with zombies anyway

## 🎮 Controls

### Chess Modes
- Click pieces to select them
- Click squares to move (revolutionary!)
- Try not to get your pieces infected

### Shooter Mode
- Arrow keys: Move your piece-ship
- Space: Shoot things
- P: Pause (for existential crises)
- R: Restart after inevitable death
- M: Return to menu (escape the madness)

## 🏆 Achievements (Because Gamification)

- **First Blood**: Kill your first enemy (in shooter mode, we're not monsters)
- **Destroyer**: Kill 100 enemies total (therapy recommended)
- **Survivor**: Survive 5 minutes (longer than most relationships)
- **Speed Demon**: Kill 50 enemies in one game (concerning)
- **Untouchable**: Survive 2 minutes without getting hit (actual skill)

## 🐛 Known Issues (Features)

- Sometimes pieces forget how to move (they're having an existential crisis)
- AI occasionally makes moves that defy physics and logic
- Zombie infections might be too realistic
- Shooter mode may cause addiction to progression systems
- CSS animations might cause seizures in people allergic to fun
- The code structure makes senior developers cry

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Energy drinks for making this possible
- Stack Overflow for solving problems we created
- The chess community for probably being horrified by this
- Anyone who actually plays this game
- The AI pieces for not achieving actual sentience (yet)

## 🎭 Final Thoughts

This project proves that with enough caffeine and questionable decision-making, you can turn a simple chess game into a multi-modal gaming experience that nobody asked for but somehow works.

Is it good code? Probably not.
Is it fun? Surprisingly yes.
Would we do it again? Absolutely.

*Built with love, chaos, and an unhealthy amount of JavaScript.*
